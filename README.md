# TTT2Hunter

DISCLAIMER: This role needs two additional weapon addons to work! See below!

This is the Hunter for TTT2.

The Hunter is an Innocent who wields two special weapons:

- The Ranger Bow, a Hunting Bow with increased ammo and a faster reload

and

- Bunnytraps, that deal only 15 damage but he has 5 of them! After picking them up again, you need to rearm them using 'Reload'. (This is technically just a regular reload so don't switch off the traps or the rearm will cancel.)
